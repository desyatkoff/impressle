                3. What is Karma?
            </h2>

            <p class="card answer">
                Karma shows your reputation to others. Also, more karma -> higher rank. If your
                karma goes negative, you will be banned for bad behavior (for example, you
                published an inappropriate picture and it got lots of dislikes)

                <br />
                <br />

            <h2 class="question">
                6. What is [ INACTIVE ] Tag?
            </h2>

            <p class="card answer">
                Every user should do some activity on Impressle, otherwise the account may be
                deleted because of inactivity. If the account was inactive for last 30 days,
                it will be marked with [ INACTIVE ] tag and the account owner (user) will
                not be able to log in to their account

                <br />
                <br />

                Just visit the website sometimes, it's not that hard. You don't have to post
                every day if you don't want to

                <br />
                <br />

                Also, if you want to leave the Impressle community forever, you can delete
                your account
                (<a href="{{ url_for('views.user_settings') }}">
                    Settings
                </a>
                -> Delete Account) and it will be marked as inactive instantly so the other
                users could understand that this account is "dead"
            </p>

                7. What If My Account/Picture/Comment Gets Banned?
            </h2>

            <p class="card answer">
                If your account gets banned, you will not be able to log in to your account anymore
                and other Users will see [ BANNED ] tag in your Profile

                <br />
                <br />

                If your picture gets banned, it will be not showing at the
                <a href="{{ url_for('views.feed') }}">
                    Feed
                </a>
                page, but users still can view the picture in your Profile

                <br />
                <br />

                If your comment gets banned, its text will be replaced with [ BANNED ]

                <br />
                <br />

                Just don't be a bad guy and everything will be fine :)
