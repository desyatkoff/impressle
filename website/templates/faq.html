                What is "Karma"?
            </h2>

            <p class="card answer">
                More karma -> higher rank

                <br />
                <br />

                You get +1 karma for publishing a picture
                <br />
                You get +1 karma for every follower
                <br />
                You get +1 karma for every like on your picture
                <br />
                You get +1 karma for every comment on your picture
                <br />
                You get -1 karma for deleting a picture
                <br />
                You get -1 karma if your picture gets banned
                <br />
                You get -1 karma if your comment gets banned
                <br />
                You get -1 karma if someone deletes their comment on your picture

                <br />
                <br />

                If your karma goes negative, you can get banned! You should get more karma because
                it shows your reputation to others
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="question">
                What is "Rank"?
            </h2>

            <p class="card answer">
                Rank shows user's reputation and skills at drawing on impressle

                <br />

                And if you want to know the details:

                <br />
                <br />

                0 karma = "Newbie" rank
                <br />
                1-24 karma = "Artist" rank
                <br />
                25-49 karma = "Amateur Artist" rank
                <br />
                50-99 karma = "Cool Guy" rank
                <br />
                100-999 karma = "Skilled" rank
                <br />
                1000+ karma = "impressive" rank

                <br />
                <br />

                Also, there are some <i>*special*</i> ranks, for example: "Admin"
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="question">
                Are there any limits on posting pictures?
            </h2>

            <p class="card answer">
                No! You can post as many pictures as you want without any limits,
                but if you will spam empty or strange pictures you will be banned
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="question">
                I saw an account marked with "[ INACTIVE ]". What does that mean?
            </h2>

            <p class="card answer">
                Every user should do some activity on impressle, otherwise the account may be
                deleted because of inactivity. If the account was inactive for last 30 days,
                it will be marked with "[ INACTIVE ]" tag and the account owner (user) will
                not be able to log in to their account

                <br />
                <br />

                Just visit the website sometimes, it's not that hard. You don't have to post
                every day if you don't want to

                <br />
                <br />

                Also, if you want to leave the impressle community forever, you can delete
                your account (<a href="{{ url_for('views.user_settings') }}">Settings</a>
                > Delete Account) and it will be marked as inactive instantly so the other
                users could understand that this account is "dead"
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="question">
                What if my account/picture/comment gets banned?
            </h2>

            <p class="card answer">
                If your account gets banned, you will not be able to log in to your account anymore
                and other Users will see "[ BANNED ]" tag in your Profile

                <br />
                <br />

                If your picture gets banned, it will be not showing at the
                <a href="{{ url_for('views.feed') }}">
                    Feed
                </a>
                page, but users still can view the picture in your Profile

                <br />
                <br />

                If your comment gets banned, its text will be replaced with "[ BANNED ]"

                <br />
                <br />

                Just don't be a bad guy :)
