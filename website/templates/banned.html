    <p>
        You can no longer log in to this account. Breaking the rules is bad, you know?
        It's allowed to create another account, and if you want to do this, then
        promise that you will not break the rules again
    </p>


    <form method="POST">
        <div class="card">
            <label for="checkbox" class="pure-checkbox">
                <input

                    id = "checkbox"
                    name = "checkbox"
                />
                I will not break the rules next time
            </label>
